random

- [x] name should come first in random to prevent any accidental changes
- [x] maybe generate the ore using the name as the random seed instead of the other way around
- [x] that way the same name will always generate the same ore

ores

- rarity
- should impact all other stats, more rare = better usually
- should negatively impact some stats (smelting time)
- should not effect some stats (blast resistsnce)
- should have a chance of being a different color than the item

resource

- shiny (based on rarity maybe)
- rarity (vanilla thing, affects name color) (based on rarity)
- change colors lightly (using getcolor for items and animations for ores)

tools [pick, shovel, axe, hoe, sword, bow?, arrow?, armor]

- stats: sharpness (for axe, arrow)
- stats: mining speed (for pick, shovel, axe, hoe)
- stats: protection (for armor) + also use blast resistance (so strong block = strong armor)

- add textures using artifice instead of using color overlays

  and fix the transparent mining bug
